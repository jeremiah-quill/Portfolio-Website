          <p>
            Wishlist is a full stack app I built in Javascript with two other developers to help
            manage secret santa gift exchanges. Users can create and join groups, and create and
            maintain a wishlist of gift ideas to be shared. Once a group is ready, the leader is
            able to randomize the choosing of secret santas and each userâ€™s wishlist is shared only
            with their secret santa. I took a leadership role on the team and handled the business
            logic on both the front and back end while my teammates handled routing and design.

          <p>
            Each gift exchange group has an event date, and my goal was to send an email one week in
            advance of this date to users who have elected to receive notifications. I wrote a
            function in our Express server that utilizes both a cron job and nodemailer to achieve
            this. I used a package called node-cron which allowed me to schedule code to be executed
            on the server. I configred the cron job to run every day at noon, which executes the
            code within my function. This function fetches all groups from our database and checks
            the event dates against the date one week in the future. Any group members who have
            elected to receive reminders will receive an automated email configured through
            Nodemailer once their event is one week away.

            The create group form, where a user is able to create a new secret santa group. Once
            created, the group owner will be able to share a group password so others are able to
            join.

            The group dashboard is only available to the user who created the group. It contains
            editable group details like name, date, and price limit. It also contains an ID and
            password that when shared with other users, allows them to join the group. Lastly, this
            page includes a draw names button which randomly matches every member of the group
            together.

//         I built this app alongside two other developers. We focused on user experience,

//         sure our goals were going to be met. Our first meetings were to discuss features and how
//         we would split up the work. I handled the business logic across the front and back ends
//         while my team members handled routing and design. The main features of our app include
//         user authentication, private groups, personal wish lists, and automated email reminders.
