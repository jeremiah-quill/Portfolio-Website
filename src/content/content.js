      "Flow with Megmo is a full stack landing page and dashboard scheduling tool built in React. I built this website from scratch for my wife, a yoga instructor who is beginning an online yoga studio. The goal was to build a tool to help manage the process of scheduling, requesting payment, and handling any communications regarding upcoming yoga classes. She needed her students to be able to sign in as a user and register for class, where they would then be able to view and interact with the available schedule.",

        "Since my wife's classes are hosted through Zoom, the admin dashboard I built allows her to interact with the Zoom API to create, delete, and update Zoom meetings. Submitting the create class form fires an API call to Zoom which creates a meeting at her selected date and time. The newly created Zoom meeting ID and details are added to my Mongo database, where GraphQL queries fetch this data to display it on the schedule available to students. The other feature I added to the admin dashboard is the ability for my wife to add her Spotify playlist to completed classes to share with her students. I fetch my wife's Spotify playlists through the Spotify API and display them in a list so she is able to choose which playlist she used for each completed class",

The AI returns a "text completion" based on this prompt, but will fail or return gibberish if the prompt is not constructed in a way that the AI can understand.  The way I solved this was by creating a specific and tested template prompt which asks the AI for recipe suggestions based on the user\'s ingredients.  The same goes for generating recipe instructions: once the user chooses which recipe they want, another API request is sent to OpenAPI with a specific text prompt which includes the user\'s selection programmatically inserted.',
