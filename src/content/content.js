      "Flow with Megmo is a full stack landing page and web app built for a yoga instructor who is beginning an online yoga studio.  The goal was to build a tool to help manage the process of scheduling, requesting payment, and handling any communications regarding upcoming yoga classes.  She needed her students to be able to sign in as a user and register for class, where they would then be able to view and interact with the client's published schedule.  Requirements included mobile responsiveness, user authentication, an admin dashboard, a production database, and automated customer email communciation.  I built a custom admin dashboard where the yoga teacher is able to create, update, and delete the classes on her schedule through the Zoom API.",

      "The app was built with the MERN stack and leverages Apollo/GraphQL to keep the database and UI in sync.  I configured Nodemailer to automate the sending of class links, class updates, and class confirmations to necessary students.  I also incorporated the Spotify API to pull in the client's spotify playlists used during class allowing her students to discover the music that inspired their workouts.  Flow with Megmo is deployed to Heroku and I continue to provide developmental support.",

      'I worked in a team of 3 to design and develop a full stack tool for managing secret santa gift exchanges.  Users are able to sign up or login, create or join a private group, and maintain an updated wishlist of gift ideas.  Once a group is ready, the leader is able to randomize the choosing of secret santas and each personâ€™s wishlist is shared only with their secret santa.  We focused on user experience, automation, and mobile responsiveness.  I took on a leadership role in the team organizing planning sessions, constantly re-aligning on the status of features, and making sure our goals were going to be met.  ',

      'The product was built with a Javascript, Express, Node, and MySQL stack.  The front end was built with the handlebars templating engine.  On the technical side I handled the internal javascript logic, the REST API routes and MySQL database queries, and configuring Nodemailer and node-cron for automated email notifications.  I also deployed the finished product to Heroku.  This project was a challenge to complete in less than 2 months but we delivered on all of our goals and produced a quality product.',

Users are able to scroll through their spotify playlists and choose which playlists to work with.
