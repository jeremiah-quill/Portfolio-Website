      'Flow with Megmo is a full stack landing page and dashboard scheduling tool built in React. I built this website from scratch for my wife, a yoga instructor who is beginning an online yoga studio. The goal was to build a tool to help manage the process of scheduling, requesting payment, and handling any communications regarding upcoming yoga classes. She needed her students to be able to sign in as a user and register for class, where they would then be able to view and interact with the available schedule.',

      content:
        "Since my wife's classes are hosted through Zoom, the admin dashboard I built allows her to interact with the Zoom API to create, delete, and update Zoom meetings. Submitting the create class form fires an API call to Zoom which creates a meeting at her selected date and time. The newly created Zoom meeting ID and details are added to my Mongo database, where GraphQL queries fetch this data to display it on the schedule available to students. The other feature I added to the admin dashboard is the ability for my wife to add her Spotify playlist to completed classes to share with her students. I fetch my wife's Spotify playlists through the Spotify API and display them in a list so she is able to choose which playlist she used for each completed class",

I used a package called node-cron which allowed me to schedule code to be executed on the server. I configred the cron job to run every day at noon, which executes the code within my function. This function fetches all groups from our database and checks the event dates against the date one week in the future.

Because the app is able to view and add to user's playlists, Spotify requires an access token that is generated once the user logs in and agrees to give the app access. Once the user has logged in and I've fetched their Spotify account information, I then use that information to fetch their most recent 20 playlists. Each playlist's songs are accessed through an endpoint returned in the playlist object, however, the tracks were paginated using a 'next' endpoint. I had to recursively fetch this next tracks endpoint until there was no next page to fetch.",
